# Advent 2020 in Elixir

This mix application is just for testing and such. If you want to run all the
solutions, run `mix day all`. I've been developing and testing by running `iex
-S mix` and running solutions in iex by typing `Day<num>.p1`. You
can also run a specific day's solution w/ `mix day <num>`.
